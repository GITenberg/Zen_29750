description: Looking for a treatise on finding nirvana? You're in the wrong place.
  Jerome Bixby's ""Zen"" is a thought-provoking tale about a lone outer-space creature
  that believes it is the last one of its kind and, as a result, no longer wishes
  to survive. Will the scientist who discovered the creature comply with its wish
  to extinguish itself -- or does he have some shocking news to deliver?
